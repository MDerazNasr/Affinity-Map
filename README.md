Overview

Built an end-to-end few-shot learning system for classifying protein families using Prototypical Networks and a 1D CNN encoder.

Motivation

Most protein families have very few labeled examples. Traditional supervised learning fails when:
	•	a class has <10 sequences
	•	new families emerge with almost zero examples
	•	datasets are heavily imbalanced

Few-shot learning directly addresses this by training the model to generalize from N-way K-shot episodes.

This project answers:

Can we learn a general-purpose embedding space where proteins cluster by family, and can we classify new families with as few as 5 examples?

Spoiler: Yes

        ↓
1D CNN Encoder → 128-dim embedding
        ↓
Episode Sampler (N-way, K-shot)
        ↓
Prototype calculation (mean embedding per class)
        ↓

        ↓
Query classification

Implements Prototypical Networks


📊 2. Results Summary

5-Way 5-Shot Classification (150 episodes)

Metric	Mean Accuracy	Std. Dev
Cosine Similarity	0.913	±0.079
Euclidean Distance	0.914	±0.087

Both metrics agree →
The embedding space is cleanly separable across families.
